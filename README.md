# Pong
This is a clone of the classic Pong game made with the [Godot 3 Game Engine](https://godotengine.org).

It was created while roughly following [Harvard's 2018 CS50: Introduction to Game Development - Lecture 0 - Pong Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10).

A [playable demo](https://dustinmeastway.github.io/pong/index.html) is hosted on Github Pages.
